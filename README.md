//Hi, Iâ€™m Willow.

//I make things that sometimes work

//If you need eyes or someone to test something, throw me a message. I have a knack for breaking things

//hit me through twitter. I'm nowhere else, so anyone who claims to be me is some cheesy bot. cheerio.



// There'll be better things here In future. For now, I am a beginner. So this'll update as I improve my skills. Maybe. Probably. Don't count on it. 
// 23/05/19 - I'm still here. Just having some issues. Programming will happen. Maybe. again, don't count on it.
